DESCRIPTION

This web application digitizes buying and selling among students within the American University of Nigeria. Even though it's built with the above institution in mind, this project can be easily adapted for any school.

RATIONALE

In my school there are lots of students who own small businesses on campus, but most times the students who are suppose to be the target market of these businesses don't even know that these businesses exist. This project seeks to bridge this gap. The ultimate goal is to help business owners on campus sell more and for buyers to easily discover products/services they seek.

FEATURES

In addition to the traditional way(email and password), this platform also allows social-authentication with Google. Logged in users could create/update/delete adverts, contact a seller,  search for a product/service, review a seller or save products in their wish list. Users could also create and update their profiles. Super users could access the admin view where they could delete ads or users among others.
